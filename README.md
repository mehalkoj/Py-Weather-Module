# Py Weather Module
Python script that creates an sqlite db, retrieves data from inputted Accuweather API credentials, stores and displays data, as well as determines what is considered old data since this is meant for the free API that has rate limits.

## Why
This is for another project I am working on that I needed to solve this rate limit problem while also not displaying outdated weather data. This will join the other collection of Py Modules that will be located on my Github.


## How To Run
Run the main.py script, have your API credentials in hand as well as city key that can be found on Accuweather's API page.
