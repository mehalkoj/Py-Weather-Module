# Py Weather Module
The purpose of this is to have a standalone module that works with another project. This is used to grab the AccuWeather API data. You can input a key for the location and the API key for the data.
At the moment it is only 12 Hour data and for the project that this is apart of and the limits of a free weather API I have it pull new data only when the data stored is 5 hours old.


## Things To Do
I still have things to work on this as well as to plan on where I want to take it.

- Adding 5 Day Weather
- More Tests


## What About The Other Tool
The tool that this will be apart of is a multi tool for desktop that will have quite a few other free api's to use.
